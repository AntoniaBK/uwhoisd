uwhoisd
=======

**IMPORTANT**: This project is an heavily modified fork of [uWhoisd](https://github.com/kgaughan/uwhoisd/)

The main change is that it uses the linux `whois` command on every call unless otherwise specified in the config.

A 'Universal WHOIS' proxy server: you query it for information about a
particular domain, it works out the correct WHOIS server to query and gives
back the correct details.
